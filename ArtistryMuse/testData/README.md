The "testData" package is used to generate, you guessed it, test data
for the AristryMuse application.  It is a groovy script that makes use
of a Java library contained within the package named "model_lib".  Where
this is a simple Java library made up of POJOs for use by the test data
generation and by the Application itself.

Additionally, this script will make use of "Lorem Ipsum" text generation
tool to fill out some needed text for descriptions and names.

Again, it also will make use of download images from Flickr in order
simulate data generated by users.  Flickr is a service that requires
a registering in order to be provided a KEY and SECRET to perform
RESTful interfacing.  This file will be located in this directory and
named "FLICKR_KEYS_and_SECRETS.properties" and will have the following content:

----------------------------------

flickr_key = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

flickr_secret = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
